Tokens will be listed on major exchanges and become digital linked assets
with gold. We expect a wide range of weekly transactions in line with the
short-term or medium-term inflow of gold prices. Token exchange value or
demand will not affect dividend payments in the next quarter, only the gold
price in the market will affect.
2.2.2 Profit Dividend Structure and Staging Model
In the long run, holding gold block tokens is an investment that can be risk
ridden because it can receive regular quarterly fixed dividends and easily
exchange money at any time. If you want to expand your portfolio of crypto
currency to invest in other crypto-currency, you can easily make swap
transactions on listed exchanges. GBK Token can define the dividend method
through two things below.
Real gold dividends or GBK tokens of real gold value after customs clearance
in Korea through actual gold mining in Guinea.
A. Distribution of GBDT by GBK Token Steak over a certain quantity
B. Dividends of ETH by GBK Token Steak for a certain quantity or more
Gold block token holders pay the dividends in GBDT token (stable coin).
Basically, in order to acquire tokens, you have to buy them on the listed
exchange and keep them in your wallet. After the purchase, in order to
receive a profit dividend, a certain level of token above must be used for the
application or for the listed exchange (deposit product). GBDT tokens (stable
coins) are only paid to holders who have staged more than a certain quantity
in time for profit distribution. GBDT token (stable coin) or paid in real gold.
2.2.3 GoldBlock Application
GoldBlock's token economy is formed around the GoldBlock application. The
GoldBlock Token Ecosystem consists of three main players: the GBK Token

application will be developed in two forms: mobile and web versions, and
GBK token holders can receive a variety of updates through the application.
